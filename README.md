# grant-website
A website designed for inclusion in an NSF grant proposal for the Evidence-Based Cybersecurity Research Group. The website was not ever hosted, but it did lead to the successful acquisition of an NSF grant and the creation of the Idenitity Theft Project, a joint project between Georgia State University's Evidence-Based Cybersecurity Research Group and UTEP.
